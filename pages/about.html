                The core gameplay is that of a tower defense game, with a number of characters ("operators") as towers.
                Melee operators can be placed on ground tiles and ranged operators on elevated tiles. Melee operators
                physically block enemies from advancing, and ranged operators deal ranged damage, heal or otherwise
                support melee operators. Players must place operators on the correct tiles to prevent the enemy from
                infiltrating the player's base. Because there is often a limited number of viable solutions, especially
                at high difficulties, Arknights has also been described as a puzzle game.

                As the player progresses through the game, they unlock more stages, operators and resources, and are
                also introduced to new types of enemies and gameplay mechanics. Levels that have been cleared with a
                three-star rating can be auto-completed without player input, as the game records the player's actions
                and replicates them.

                The game also has a base-building aspect, which allows players to construct facilities and assign
                operators to them. This allows players to increase their resources in the manner of an incremental
                game. It features the usual array of free-to-play, gacha game mechanics, such as daily login rewards
                and randomized character acquisition through virtual currency which can be obtained by playing the game,
                through limited-time events, or optional in-app purchases using real currency.
