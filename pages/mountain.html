                        The first 6â˜… Brawler Guard arrives on the scene with various tools at his disposal. His Talent
                        has a chance to increase his ATK and reduce the ATK of his target(s). The "chance"
                        applies only to his ATK increase, clear. This is useful in his own survivability, especially
                        when he is blocking multiple enemies, but could also be used to help out an Operator tanking enemy damage if placed
                        strategically.

                        Currently has the highest heal per second in the game (7% of MAX HP).
