                    <p>
                        Whimsical, carefree, wandering
                        by herself all day, no one knows what she's looking for. All they know is that she has a record
                        book, filled with nonsensical location names. When she arrives at a place, she'd speak to
                        herself, and cross out one of the names. She wouldn't belittle someone without reason, but her
                        attitude during conversations is not friendly. 

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        She's the best boss-killer in the game, due to her sheer magical DPS and her talents.
